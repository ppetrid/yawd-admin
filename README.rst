yawd-admin is an 
administration website for django. It extends the default django admin 
site and offers the following:

* A clean and beautiful bootstrap user interface
* Hand-written pure HTML5/CSS3 code with indented HTML output
* Responsive interface, optimized for mobile phones and tablets
* Register custom database settings (options) editable from the UI. You can use all **standard django form fields** for these settings
* Integration with google analytics for displaying statistics in the admin home page
* Register your applications to the top-bar navigation
* Refurbished original django admin widgets
* Mechanism for opening the original django admin popup windows with fancybox
* Seamless integration with `yawd-translations` for multilingual admin websites
